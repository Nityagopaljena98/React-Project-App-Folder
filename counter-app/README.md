# Counter App Using React

This is a functional Counter App built using ReactJS, showcasing React fundamentals like state management(useState), side effects(useEffect), and persistent storage using localStorage.

## Features

1. Increment the Counter

   - Allows the user to increase the counter value by 1.

2. Decrement the Counter

   - Allows the user to decrease the counter value by 1.

3. Reset the Counter

   - Resets the counter value to 0.

4. Persistent Counter Value
   - The counter value is saved in the browser's localStorage.
   - The app retrieves the last saved value from localStorage when the page reloads, ensuring the counter value persists even after refreshing the page.
